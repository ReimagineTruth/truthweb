# Two-Factor Authentication

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a critical security feature of **TruthWeb** , designed to add an extra layer of protection to user accounts. By requiring users to provide two forms of verification before accessing their accounts, 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if login credentials are compromised.

Below is a detailed breakdown of how **Two-Factor Authentication** works, its benefits, implementation details, and use cases.

### **Overview** \<a name="overview">\</a>

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** requires users to verify their identity using two independent factors:

1. **Something You Know** : Password or PIN.
2. **Something You Have** : A one-time code sent to a mobile device or generated by an authenticator app.

This ensures that even if a malicious actor gains access to a user's password, they cannot log in without the second factor.

***

### **How It Works** \<a name="how-it-works">\</a>

The **Two-Factor Authentication** process involves the following steps:

1. **Login Attempt** :
   * The user enters their username and password on the login page.
2. **Trigger 2FA** :
   * If 2FA is enabled, the system prompts the user to complete the second verification step.
3. **Verification Methods** :
   * Users can choose from multiple 2FA methods:
     * **SMS-Based** : A one-time code is sent to the user's registered phone number.
     * **Authenticator App** : A time-based one-time password (TOTP) is generated using apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
     * **Email-Based** : A verification link or code is sent to the user's email address.
4. **Code Entry** :
   * The user enters the verification code or approves the login request.
5. **Access Granted** :
   * Once the code is verified, the user gains access to their account.
6. **Backup Options** :
   * Users can generate backup codes during setup to regain access in case they lose their primary 2FA method.

***

### **Key Benefits** \<a name="key-benefits">\</a>

1. **Enhanced Security** :
   * Protects accounts from unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.
2. **User Trust** :
   * Builds confidence among users by ensuring their accounts are secure.
3. **Compliance** :
   * Aligns with global security standards and best practices for online platforms.
4. **Reduced Fraud** :
   * Prevents phishing attacks and brute-force attempts.
5. **Flexibility** :
   * Offers multiple 2FA methods to suit user preferences.

***

### **Implementation Details** \<a name="implementation-details">\</a>

#### **Core Components**

1. **Authentication Server** :
   * Manages user credentials and 2FA requests.
   * Example: Verifies TOTP codes generated by authenticator apps.
2. **Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)** :
   * Uses algorithms like HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) to generate time-sensitive codes.
3. **Smart Contracts** :
   * Automate the verification process for decentralized applications.

```solution-file
// Solidity Smart Contract for 2FA Verification
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TwoFactorAuth {
    mapping(address => uint256) public secretKeys;
    mapping(address => bool) public is2FAEnabled;

    event TwoFactorEnabled(address indexed user);
    event TwoFactorDisabled(address indexed user);

    function enable2FA(uint256 secretKey) external {
        secretKeys[msg.sender] = secretKey;
        is2FAEnabled[msg.sender] = true;
        emit TwoFactorEnabled(msg.sender);
    }

    function disable2FA() external {
        require(is2FAEnabled[msg.sender], "2FA not enabled");
        delete secretKeys[msg.sender];
        is2FAEnabled[msg.sender] = false;
        emit TwoFactorDisabled(msg.sender);
    }

    function verifyCode(uint256 code) external view returns (bool) {
        require(is2FAEnabled[msg.sender], "2FA not enabled");
        uint256 expectedCode = generateTOTP(secretKeys[msg.sender]);
        return code == expectedCode;
    }

    function generateTOTP(uint256 secretKey) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp / 30; // 30-second intervals
        return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(secretKey, timestamp))) % 1000000;
    }
}
```

**API Integration** :

* APIs connect the frontend (login page) with the backend (2FA verification).
* Example: An API endpoint to verify TOTP codes.

```javascript
app.post('/api/verify-2fa', async (req, res) => {
    const { userId, code } = req.body;
    const isValid = await verifyTOTP(userId, code);
    if (isValid) {
        res.json({ success: true });
    } else {
        res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid 2FA code" });
    }
});
```

1. **Backup Codes** :
   * Users can generate and store backup codes during 2FA setup.

### **Use Cases** \<a name="use-cases">\</a>

1. **Account Protection** :
   * Secures user accounts from unauthorized access.
2. **Wallet Security** :
   * Protects Pi wallets from theft or hacking attempts.
3. **Marketplace Transactions** :
   * Ensures only authorized users can initiate transactions.
4. **Escrow System** :
   * Adds an extra layer of security for high-value trades.
5. **Admin Access** :
   * Protects admin accounts with sensitive permissions.
