# About Us

### Who We Are

TruthWeb is an open-source platform launched on March 5, 2025, designed to empower Pi Network Pioneers by providing a decentralized hub for transactions, community engagement, and developer innovation. As outlined in our whitepaper, our mission is to create a secure, efficient, and community-driven environment where Pioneers can leverage Pi for real-world utility, fostering trust, transparency, and innovation.

Founded with the vision to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and practical utility, TruthWeb integrates Pi into everyday life through a robust ecosystem. We address the Pi Network’s challenges—such as limited trading options and fragmented tools—by offering features like a multi-category marketplace, fast P2P trading, Pi wallet integration, custom profiles, and enhanced security with KYC and 2FA, as detailed in our whitepaper (Version 1.0).

Built on a decentralized framework with Pi Network’s blockchain technology, TruthWeb’s initial codebase uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with TailwindCSS for a responsive UI. Future plans include a Node.js backend and Pi API integration for real-time functionality, reflecting our commitment to scalability and community-driven development. Join us in redefining how Pioneers interact, transact, and collaborate within the Pi ecosystem.
