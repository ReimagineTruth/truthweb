# Our Tech Stack

#### **The TruthWeb Technology Stack**

The **TruthWeb** platform is built on a robust and modern technology stack that ensures scalability, security, and user-friendliness. Below is a detailed breakdown of the technologies and frameworks used in the development of **TruthWeb** , categorized into frontend, backend, database, and additional tools.

***

### **1. Frontend Technology Stack**

The frontend is designed to provide a seamless and responsive user experience across devices. It leverages modern web development tools and frameworks.

#### **Core Technologies**

* **HTML5** : The foundation for structuring content.
* **CSS3** : Used for styling and animations.
* **TailwindCSS** :
  * A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  * CDN link: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
  * Provides pre-built classes for responsive design, spacing, typography, and more.
* **Font Awesome (v6.5.1)** :
  * Icon library for intuitive UI elements.
  * CDN link: `<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>`
  * Icons are used for navigation, buttons, and visual cues.
* **Google Fonts: Poppins** :
  * A clean and modern font for improved readability.
  * CDN link: `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"/>`

#### **JavaScript Enhancements**

* **Vanilla JavaScript** :
  * Handles dynamic interactions such as search functionality, lazy loading, and menu toggling.
  * Example: The `burger-btn` toggle for mobile navigation.
* **Intersection Observer API** :
  * Used for lazy loading images to improve performance.
  * Example:

```javascript
const imageObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      const img = entry.target;
      img.src = img.dataset.src;
      imageObserver.unobserve(img);
    }
  });
});
```

#### **Responsive Design**

* TailwindCSS utilities and custom media queries ensure responsiveness across devices:
  * Mobile: `max-width: 640px`
  * Tablet: `min-width: 641px and max-width: 1024px`
  * Desktop: `min-width: 1025px`
* Adaptive layouts for headers, footers, and navigation menus.

### **2. Backend Technology Stack**

The backend powers the core functionalities of **TruthWeb** , including user authentication, marketplace operations, and API integrations.

#### **Core Technologies**

* **Node.js** :
  * A runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications.
  * Example: Handling API requests for wallet management and marketplace data.
* **Express.js** :
  * A lightweight framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic.
  * Example:

```javascript
app.get('/api/user/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  const userData = await fetchUserData(userId);
  res.json(userData);
});
```

* **Authentication** :
  * Firebase Authentication or OAuth for secure login.
  * Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

#### **APIs**

* **Pi Network API** :
  * Fetches wallet balances, transaction history, and marketplace listings.
  * Example: `/api/wallet/:userId`
* **External APIs** :
  * Integration with services like CoinGecko for market data or OpenExchangeRates for currency conversion.

### **3. Database Technology Stack**

The database layer ensures secure and efficient storage of user data, transactions, and marketplace listings.

#### **Core Technologies**

* **Firebase Firestore** :
  * A NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization.
  * Used for storing user profiles, wallet data, and marketplace listings.
* **PostgreSQL** :
  * A relational database for structured data like transaction histories and analytics.
* **Decentralized Storage** :
  * Integration with blockchain-based storage solutions like IPFS for secure and tamper-proof data storage.

***

### **4. Blockchain and Smart Contracts**

TruthWeb integrates blockchain technology to enable decentralized features.

* **Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain** :
  * Facilitates cross-chain interoperability through wrapped tokens and bridges.
* **Smart Contracts** :
  * Written in Solidity for Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
  * Example: Bridge System for wrapping Pi tokens.

```solution-file
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == bridgeAddress, "Only bridge can mint");
    balanceOf[to] += amount;
    totalSupply += amount;
    emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount);
}
```

### **5. Security and Fraud Detection**

Security is a top priority for TruthWeb, ensuring user trust and data integrity.

#### **Core Technologies**

* **End-to-End Encryption** :
  * Protects sensitive data during transmission.
